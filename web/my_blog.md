## My Blog

This is very easy challenge, as the description suggests "you may find a good application for you memory". All you have to do is inspect the blog and select application.

Developer tools are my favourite, it is the most important to check when participating in a CTF competition like this one to identify vulnerabilities in web application, debug code and analyze network traffic. You'll find so many information using these tools.
